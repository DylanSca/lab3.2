Project: clock-display
Authors: David Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Sixth edition

It is discussed in chapter 3.

To use this project, create an instance of class ClockDisplay. Then inspect this 
instance and leave the object inspector window open. With the inspector window open, 
call the object's methods, such as timeTick and setTime. Watch the 
"displayString" in the inspector.

The displayString field simulates the actual clock display device. Were this 
program running in a real clock, it would change the real, physical display 
hardware instead of this string. The timeTick method would be triggered once 
every minute by some timer hardware.

Everything else could be pretty much the same.


Note: This project does not implement adequate handling of errors.


Answers

21: 00:00, becuase it the begining of the time cycle
23: 60, set time method
24: NumberDisplay digit; digit = new NumberDisplay(10);
25:  Rectangle window; and window = new Rectangle(8, 12);
26: it sets the limits of hours and minutes and lets you input and set your hours and minutes
27: in one it starts at 00:00 the other you can set your own time and the reason for no updateDisplay is becuase your starting from a time you set
28:p1.print("Document1.pdf", true); and p1.print("Notes.txt", false); 
int status1 = p1.getStatus(5); and int status2 = p1.getStatus(10);
32: 2
33: same result just negivie
34: 1 2 3 4 
35: all numbers
